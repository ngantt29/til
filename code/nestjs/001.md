- Module is an abstract idea that groups certain functionality. (import Controller and Service)
- Controllers let you define your API endpoints.
- Service is a class where you'll put the business logic of the application

## Controllers
- The job of controllers is to create endpoints in your application using specific paths and Http verbs.

-> Then to accept requests, pass on the processing of that request to some other code in your project and then return back the response back to the client.
=> It controls the process of handling a request.
